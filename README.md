## Summary
In summary, June and December are very close in terms of maximum, minimum, and average temperatures. This indicates that Oahu is an ideal location to set up a surf and ice cream shop that can operate year-round. Another query that can be made regarding weather in June and December could be on the average amount of storms that impact the island. Lastly, a query on wind speeds for the months of June and December would be beneficial as it affects surfing conditions.
